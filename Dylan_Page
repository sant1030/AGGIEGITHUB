#Texas A&M Traditions
Texas A&M has many traditions that are unique to the school. Some of these include:
1. Not having cheerleaders but rather yell leaders
2. Having our famous Aggie War Hymn
3. The fans being refered to as the 12th man
4. Midnight Yell where the students can practice the yells for the games

Texas A&M formas president Gates talks about the importance of traditions in saying:
> “Were we to become a top ten university and lose that spirit,
those traditions, our culture, we would be nothing more than
another giant education factory; a big brain with no heart. Hell,
we might as well be in Austin.”
