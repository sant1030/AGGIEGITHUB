# AGGIE STUDENT SECTION
The A&M student section is pretty unique in the sense that we are derived from long standing traditions and sanctions.
We have incorporated official yells that we all practice for cheering the team on during games.
Since A&M has one of the largest student body populations, we in turn have one of the largest student sections in the nation.
