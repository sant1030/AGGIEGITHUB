# BLOG ON AGGIE FOOTBALL
Reasons we should still be a top contender for the College Football Playoffs after Week 2
1. We are still undefeated and even though we barely beat Colorado 10-7, it is because we lost our starting QB
2. Our defense is top 5 in the country and we lock everyone up
3. Ohio State lost and they were number 3 so they be moved down after us
4. We are just getting started and coming for Bama!
5. Jimbo

## Current Standings for Aggie Football
We have currently only played a couple of games and shown some promising aspects of good football.
The two games we have played have been:
* Aggies vs. Kent State - W for Aggies
* Aggies vs. CU Boulder - W for Aggies

## What we need to do to play and win more in games in the next weeks
1. Run the ball more and give Spiller more touches
2. Do not let Calzada throw as much because he is throwing some risky passes
3. Wydermyer needs to be looked at more often
4. We have a 5 star receiver why is he not playing as much??

## The A&M V.S T.U Rivalry
So since T.U got destroyed by Arkansas, when we play them in a couple weeks, and when we beat them does that mean we would have destroyed T.U in a rivalry game? T.U is scared now since they will be joining the SEC soon...
