Reveille II was a donated by the class of 1900. This Reveille was a Shetland Sheep dog. After Reveille II, every Reveille since has been a pure-bred Rough Collie. Reveille X is the current mascot.



Texas A&M maintains a cemetery on campus where all of the past Reveilles are buried. Reveilles I through IV were buried side by side in a small cemetery in front of Kyle Field with their noses and paws pointed so that they could look through the north tunnel and see the stadium scoreboard. This way, "they can always watch the Aggies outscore their opponent on the field.". In 1997, the university decided to expand Kyle Field and build the Bernard C. Richardson Zone at the north end of the stadium. This necessitated the removal of the cemetery. After meeting with representatives of the Traditions Council, Student Senate, and E-2, the athletic department decided to create a temporary cemetery across the street in Cain Park. Upon completion of the stadium addition in 1999, the graves were relocated to a permanent cemetery at the new, tree-lined Richardson Zone Plaza. Since the recent additions blocked the gravesites' view of Kyle Field, a miniature scoreboard was constructed on the outside of the stadium so that the previous mascots can still watch the Aggies play.
