Reveille is the official mascot of Texas A&M. She has been the offical mascot of the school since 1931. THe first Reveille was a a small black and white mut. Reveille II was a donated by the class of 1900. This Reveille was a Shetland Sheep dog. After Reveille II, every Reveille since has been a pure-bred Rough Collie. Reveille X is the current mascot.



Texas A&M maintains a cemetery on campus where all of the past Reveilles are buried. Reveilles I through IV were buried side by side in a small cemetery in front of Kyle Field with their noses and paws pointed so that they could look through the north tunnel and see the stadium scoreboard. This way, "they can always watch the Aggies outscore their opponent on the field.". In 1999 after the Bernard C. Richardson Zone expansion was completed, the Reveille cemetary was relocated to the Richardson Zone Plaza. Since the view of the field was obstructed by the new zone, a small scoreboard was added so that way the Previous Reveille's could still watch the Aggies play.
